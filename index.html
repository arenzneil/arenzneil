Other atoms don’t generally have a round-number atomic masses for reasons that are a little beyond the scope of this article. In general, though, an atom’s atomic mass will be very close to its mass number, but will have some deviation in the decimal places (UC Davis, 2015).

                          It is calculated as:

                            In columns from top to bottom the atomic volume increases while in the period from left to right decreases first then increases.
                          Hence, atomic volume is calculated as the ratio of gram atomic weight to the density of elements in solid form.

                        <h5>who is democritus?</h5>
                        <p><b>According to ancient reports, Democritus was born about 460 BCE (thus, he was a younger contemporary of Socrates) and was a citizen of Abdera, although some reports mention Miletus. As well as his associate or teacher Leucippus, Democritus is said to have known Anaxagoras, and to have been forty years younger than the latter (DK 68A1). A number of anecdotes concern his life, but their authenticity is uncertain.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Democritus, known in antiquity as the ‘laughing philosopher’ because of his emphasis on the value of ‘cheerfulness,’ was one of the two founders of ancient atomist theory. He elaborated a system originated by his teacher Leucippus into a materialist account of the natural world. The atomists held that there are smallest indivisible bodies from which everything else is composed, and that these move about in an infinite void.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          He believed that atoms were uniform, solid, hard, incompressible, and indestructible and that they moved in infinite numbers through empty space until stopped. Differences in atomic shape and size determined the various properties of matter. In Democritus’s philosophy, atoms existed not only for matter but also for such qualities as perception and the human soul. 
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Democritus developed his atomic philosophy as a middle ground between two opposing Greek theories about reality and the illusion of change. He argued that matter was subdivided into indivisible and immutable particles that created the appearance of change when they joined and separated from others.

                        <h5>who is lucretius?</h5>
                        <p><b>Lucretius was an atomist and a materialist who believed that nature consisted of two fundamental principles, the atom and the void. He also argued against supernatural causes of phenomena in favor of natural ones.
                          Over 2,000 years ago, the Roman poet Titus Lucretius Carus (c. 99 BC- c. 55 BC) declared in verse that the universe was made of an infinite number of atoms.
                         <br>
                         <br>
                         Lucretius's stated aim in his six-book poem, De Rerum Natura, is to free us from fear by enabling us to understand Epicurean philosophy, so giving us the rational explanation of phenomena that have previously attracted irrational explanation and thus created fear of the gods in men's minds – the soul, for example, or thunderbolts. 
                         <br>
                         <br>
                         Atoms in the Lucretian universe are accompanied by void – completely empty space, without any particles in it – both outside and within objects. Without it, there would be no motion, because there would be no space without particles in it into which particles could move, and a ball of wool would weigh the same as a ball of lead. Plenty of material objects have void in them, and can be destroyed; but the matter that doesn't have void in it can't be. Atoms and void are complementary: atoms are particles without void in them, and void is space without particles in it.

                        <p><b>Around 2500 years ago a Greek philosopher called Leucippus and his pupil Demokritos put forward the idea that the universe is made up of tiny indivisible particles, which they called atoms. Unfortunately the great Greek philosopher Aristotle did not agree with them. As Aristotle views were accepted throughout Europe for almost 2000 years the idea of atoms was shelved for centuries to come.

                          Atoms are the building blocks of matter. They combine in numerous patterns and form different substances. All atoms except the common form of hydrogen contain protons, neutrons and electrons. The atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons in its nucleus. In a neutral atom, the number of protons equals the number of electrons in shells which is the energy level around the nucleus.

                          The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom, which is equal to the number of electrons in a neutral (non-ionized) atom. Each atomic number defines a particular element, but not an isotope; the number of neutrons in an atom of a given element may vary widely. The mass number of an atom is determined by the number of nucleons (both protons and neutrons) in its nucleus, and each isotope of a given element has a different mass number.

In fact, the number of protons in each atom is its atomic number. Proton's primary characteristics are mass or mp (1 atomic mass unit (AMU)) and charge (+1) — also commonly denoted by the symbols e, P, and +. Protons are made up of fundamental particles called quarks (two up quarks and a down quark) held together by gluons (Adam Roufberg, 2021).

                          The discovery of the proton dates to the earliest investigations of atomic structure. While studying streams of ionized gaseous atoms and molecules from which electrons had been stripped, Wilhelm Wien (1898) and J.J. Thomson (1910) identified a positive particle equal in mass to the hydrogen atom. Ernest Rutherford (1919) showed that nitrogen under alpha-particle bombardment ejects what appear to be hydrogen nuclei (Britannica,2023).

                          It was found that atoms typically have a mass that’s more than twice the mass of the electrons plus the protons; and this led scientists to speculate about the existence of another massive nuclear particle, one that has no electrical charge, and therefore is much more difficult to detect.

                          It wasn’t until 1932 that British physicist James Chadwick discovered the neutron. He conducted experiments very similar to those of Rutherford. In Chadwick’s case, he fired his atomic bullets at the element beryllium, not gold. The resulting collisions produced a new kind of particle that was just as massive as the proton, but it penetrated through several inches of lead.

                  By 1910, it was clear that certain radioactive processes, discovered a few years earlier by French physicist Henri Becquerel, had the ability to change one element into another. Tiny amounts of previously unseen radioactive substances were discovered in ores containing the radioactive elements uranium and thorium, in particular. Because these compounds were thought to be elements, they were given distinct names. Ionium was created from uranium ores, and mesothorium was created from thorium ores.

When they are enclosed in a shell, electrons have "constant energy". When the electrons in these atoms seize the energy and enter an orbit with higher energy, this presumption refers to them as "excited" electrons. When they return to their main orbit, they emit electromagnetic radiation as a result of this energy. According to the postulates given below, the electrons within the atoms are placed in distinct orbits known as "stationary orbits"
